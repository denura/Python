1. You are asked to ensure that the first and last names of people begin with a capital letter in their passports.
For example, alison heck should be capitalized correctly as Alison Heck. 
Given a full name, your task is to capitalize the name appropriately. 
Input Format:A single line of input containing the full name, S.
Constraints:* 0 < len(S) < 1000* 
The string consists of alphanumeric characters and spaces.
Note: in a word only the first character is capitalized. 
Example 12abc when capitalized remains 12abc.
Output Format:Print the capitalized string, S.

2. Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string.
Sample String : google.com
Expected Result : {'o': 3, 'g': 2, '.': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 1, 'm': 1, 'c': 1}

3. Write a Python program to get a string made of the first 2 and the last 2 chars from a given a string. If the string length is less than 2, return instead of the empty string. 
Sample String : 'w3resource'
Expected Result : 'w3ce'
Sample String : 'w3'
Expected Result : 'w3w3'
Sample String : ' w'
Expected Result : Empty String

4. Write a Python program to count the number of strings where the string length is 2 or more and the first and last character are same from a given list of strings. 
Sample List : ['abc', 'xyz', 'aba', '1221']
Expected Result : 2

5. You are given with 3 sets, find if third set is a subset of the first and the second sets
Input: set([1,2]), set([2,3), set([2])
Expected result: True
Input: set([1,2]), set([3,4), set([5])
Expected result: False
 
6. Write a Python script to generate and print a dictionary that contains a number (between 1 and n) in the form (x, x*x). 
Sample Dictionary ( n = 5) :
Expected Output : {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25} 

7. Write a Python script to merge two Python dictionaries

8. Write a Python program to find the highest 3 values in a dictionary

9. Write a Python program to remove duplicates from a list.

10. Write a Python program to get the difference between the two lists
